              The concept of oss.gg üïπÔ∏è emerged from a common challenge faced by many open source founders and

            Around 18 months ago, we released snoopForms - the Open Source Typeform alternative. Within days,
            we had people request features and offer contributions to make snoopForms better. While we loved
            the spirit, we quickly experienced the challenges that come along with running an open source
            community.

            The Open Source Renaissance and what it did to communities
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-3">
            With the rise of hugely popular app-based open source tools like Supabase, Appflowy, Cal.com (and
            Formbricks obviously üòã) Open Source Software (OSS) experiences a renaissance. And it seems that
            this significantly impacts the composition of open source communities:
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            Five years ago, open source contributions were mostly done by experienced engineers with domain
            expertise who wanted to bring a new technology to the world.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            Today, this cohort is outnumbered by young, aspiring engineers predominantly from India, Pakistan,
            Nigeria, Kenia and several other countries throughout Africa. They are mostly interested in
            working on a product with real users, learn new technologies, learn from more experienced product
            people and engineers and build a portfolio of contributions to land a job in tech.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            When the community changes, a new set of issues arises. These issues call for a new set of tools,
            one of which is oss.gg üïπÔ∏è - but let&apos;s look at what we&apos;re solving first:
          </p>
          <h3 className="mb-4 mt-3 text-2xl font-medium" id="the-problems">
            The problem(s)
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-3">
            With a new set of community members contributing to open source, we see a new problems:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal space-y-3 p-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Handholding required: </strong>
              Many of the engineers wanting to contribute have little experience in software engineering or
              web development. They ask a lot of questions, get stuck, need help. While maintainers are
              usually happy to help the first set of contributors, it quickly gets out of hand. We&apos;ve
              referred juniors to ChatGPT a lot, but some things need to be explained. While it&apos;s fun to
              teach, we have to make sure the efforts are not in vain because the contributor does not stick
              around.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Seniors leaving: </strong>
              Every now and then, a more senior engineer gets excited by a project and contributes.
              That&apos;s obviously really cool and valuable. The issue? They usually don&apos;t stick around.
              While it&apos;s not an issue that a company with a commercialisation interest maintains a
              project (vs. a completely free and community-run project) these seniors make 1, 2, 3
              contributions and then ask themselves, why they are spending their evenings and weekends
              creating value which will be harvest by someone else. Curiosity and altruism only go so far. So
              why not pay them?{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Incentive dilemma: </strong>
              Incentives are a funny thing because they can shift the mental model for looking at something.
              There is lots of research proving that a financial incentive can lower the motivation for a
              specific task, because it takes the aspects of reciprocity and signalling out of the picture: If
              I receive money for it, I won&apos;t get a favour back nor can I tell myself I worked for the
              greater good and feel good about it. This, and the short-term thinking attached to doing the
              minimum to get the financial reward make it difficult to just hang a price tag to an issue and
              wait for someone to fix it properly. In most cases, it&apos;s a quick and dirty patch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Review overhead: </strong>
              Most tools of the Open Source Renaissance are maintained by small teams. These teams are busy
              shipping features requested by their design partners or large clients because after all, they
              are who keep the project alive. Reviewing community contributions generally and submitted by
              junior devs unfamiliar with the code base is verrry time-consuming. We have to minimize the
              effort reviews take to make the whole effort worthwhile.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Manual recognition: </strong>
              People keep coming back when they feel recognized. It not only feels good to be appreciated for
              the time invested but is also an important signal, for both side: Contributors can showcase
              their work publicly (and share it) and projects show that their project is actively contributed
              to. Win win. The only issue? It&apos;s time-consuming to keep track, write content and find the
              social handles of contributors to tag them. This can be semi-automated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hard to flex: </strong>
              Along with the projects effort to recognize contributors, these contributors have a hard time
              flexing with their contributions. There isn&apos;t really a good plaform to do that. Important
              contributions on GitHub profiles get lost in other activity. CVs are outdated. Contributors want
              a publicly accessible page where they can collect contributions like stickers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Assignment overhead &amp; redundant work: </strong>
              Keeping track of who works on which issue can get messy with an active community. We ran a
              hackathon with a Macbook prize and for every issue we released we had 5 people who wanted to
              work on it. First come, first assigned works well, until people claim issues and don&apos;t
              deliver. This can be solved by automating the enforcement of rules such as ‚ÄúIf you don&apos;t
              open a draft PR within 48h, we will assign the issue to the next developer in line‚Äù.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unfinished PRs: </strong>
              Along the lines of the previous problem: If contributors drop out, maintainers have to notice.
              To be able to do that we have to monitor all issues manually. It&apos;d be much easier if a
              GitHub app would do that for us.

            Algora&apos;s Bounty System
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-3">
            The Algora team did a great job building a well-functioning GitHub app as well as attracting a
            community of bounty-hungry contributors. However, tying back to what I wrote above about
            incentives, I don&apos;t think it solves the right problem. In our experience (and what I&apos;ve
            heard from other projects) it&apos;s not hard to find people who want to contribute. It&apos;s
            much harder to handle the contributions and keep people familiar with the code base engaged over
            longer periods of time. To some extent, bounties make the situation worse by sending engineers our
            way who are only looking for a quick buck. They tend to be more spammy and push for a quick review
            of their half-baked code. This might sound harsh but it has been exactly our experience.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            We strongly believe in bounties and they are an essential element of oss.gg üïπÔ∏è but they have to be

            the levels we came up with at Formbricks, but each project will be able to come up with their own
            levels which align with their brand voice and ideas:

          <Image src={Levels1} alt="Levels are fun" className="mb-6 mt-4 rounded-lg" />
          <p className="pb-3">
            The beauty of levels is that they make it very easy to communicate and understand who is allowed
            to do what. Here is an overview:
          </p>
          <Image src={Levels2} alt="so much fun" className="mb-6 mt-4 rounded-lg" />
          <p className="pb-3">How does this help us? Let&apos;s look at the problems:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 p-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Handholding</strong>: By limiting who can get assigned to e.g. issues for end-to-end
              features, we limit the requests for handholding significantly. We know that every ‚ÄúDeploy
              Deputy‚Äù already went through a set of DevRel related tasks so is somewhat familiar with the code
              base and tech stack. Secondly, we can filter out a lot of the ‚ÄúI can quickly ship this‚Äù
              engineers. Additionally, we as a team don&apos;t have to help dozens of engineers set up their
              development environment by limiting support to GitPod when contributors are getting started.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Seniors leaving + incentive dilemma:</strong> Earning the right to be paid for
              contributions has a lot of positive side effects. We exclude the ‚Äúquick-buck-engineers‚Äù and
              reward sticking around our community. Everyone in the Pushmaster Prime level has merged several
              PRs in our repo so we know they are familiar with the code style and capable. This allows us to
              pay out high bounties without having to fear a lot of spam in out repo and Discord.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="pb-3">
            These are only a handful of very basic ideas of what you can do with levels. Super excited to see
            what other projects will invent and implement ü§ì

            Leveling up, merch and moments of celebration
          </h4>
          <p className="pb-3">
            A core aspect of building a community people love is sharing moments of celebration with others.
            As an aspiring open source contributor, there are a few moments we want to celebrate together: The
            first PR getting merged, the first bounty earned, etc.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            Secondly, handling merch is kinda annoying: You have to determine who gets merch, when and why. We
            decided to just tie it to leveling up, so that we can semi-automate it. If a user levels up, we
            check if their address is added and if not, we ask them to update it. Once this is done, we can
            order their merch (or even automate that as well).
          </p>
          <h4 className="mb-4 mt-3 text-xl font-medium" id="automations">
            Automations
          </h4>
          <p className="pb-3">
            The second big advantage of oss.gg üïπÔ∏è is that you can automate many of the tedious tasks - while
            making sure that the personal touch is not getting lost. The key here is to strike the right
            balance.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            Here is an example for what happens when a new issue is released which is flagged as a community
            issue:
          </p>
          <Image src={Auto1} alt="Automations 2" className="mb-6 mt-4 rounded-lg" />
          <Image src={Auto2} alt="Automations" className="mb-6 mt-4 rounded-lg" />
          <p className="pb-3">
            As you can see, most of the overhead is automated away. We go from Issue ‚Üí Review without anyone
            in our team having to touch the issue on GitHub. Especially when the number of issues grows, this
            will come in super handy.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            Here is another one: The <strong>Merge Celebration Flow.</strong>{" "}

          <p className="pb-3">
            It nicely shows how the community management side can get automated without losing the personal
            touch. You get the idea!

          <p className="pb-3">
            Now that we have an understanding of what we want to build and why, let&apos;s talk about the how.
            oss.gg üïπÔ∏è consists of 5 different parts:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal p-4">

            <li>A bounty system +</li>
            <li>An automations interface</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="pb-3">Let&apos;s go through them one by one:</p>
          <h3 className="mb-4 mt-3 text-xl font-medium" id="1-a-web-app-">
            1. A Web App
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-3">
            The heart of oss.gg üïπÔ∏è is a web app. Both contributors and projects can sign up to preform a set
            of actions. Here is a preliminary overview of what people can do with the web app:

          <p className="pt-3">

            2. An API
          </h3>
          <p className="pb-3">
            The API provides all oss.gg üïπÔ∏è related info so that the projects can display them on their
            community pages. Think of it as an enrichment layer over the GitHub API. It serves:

            <li>Contributor Rank</li>
            <li>Contributor social handles and addresses to build automations</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="pb-3">
            This allows projects to build dynamic community pages like these easily:{" "}

            The GitHub app takes over many of the tasks which currently require manual work. It makes the

          <p className="pb-3">
            Shoutout to Bailey who built a low-fee bounty system for the OSSHack in NYC. It&apos;s a very
            convenient and inexpensive way to pay out bounties worldwide. We&apos;ll leverage that for anyone
            who wants to open a bounty for an issue.

            Create automations based on triggers like ‚ÄúContributor reaches new Level‚Äù or ‚ÄúContributor reaches
            X points‚Äù or ‚ÄúFirst contribution‚Äù etc. These automations help us provide a personalized community
            experience at scale, because we can e.g. create a new Linear ticket for the Marketing team
            containing all info needed to write a tweet and send a personal message to the contributor within
            60 seconds.

            We&apos;ve shipped the core for this launch so that we as a community can pick up the fun stuff

          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            <strong>Phase 1:</strong> To keep iteration cycles short, we limit the number of projects who can
            participate to 2 (Formbricks and oss.gg). This allows us to build a solution which is somewhat
            generalizable (vs. Formbricks-specific). And less people involved = faster shipping speed! Once we
            have figured what works well we move to Phase 2.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            <strong>Phase 2:</strong> We open oss.gg üïπÔ∏è up to a total of 5 select projects. These projects
            commit to work closely with the community by providing sufficient open issues for the community
            members to work on.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-3">
            <strong>Phase 3:</strong> Opening up to more and more projects. When and how will be determined in
            the future.
