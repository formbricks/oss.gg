In this file, we will keep track of the different PM tasks performed for oss.gg.

This serves a few purposes:

1. We can handle points awarding via a MERGE
2. We document the work we do for new people to join
3. Non technical people get familiarized with how Git works

At a later stage we will make this available either on oss.gg or the oss.gg app.

For now, it's a simple txt file :)
